# 9. *Loop Detection*: Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm that returns the node at the beginning of the loop.
#
# ```
# DEFINITION
# Circular linked list: A (corrupt) linked list in which a node's next pointer points to an earlier node, so as to make a loop in the linked list.
# ```

# ```
# EXAMPLE
# Input: A->8->C->D->E-> C[thesameCasearlier] Output: C
# Hints: #50, #69, #83, #90
